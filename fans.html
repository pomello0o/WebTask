                    As much as I dislike Barkely, Alonso, Willian etc going to multiple games this season I haven’t once booed a single player. Booing Jorginho , singing “fuck Sarriball” are you kidding me Chelsea fans? What an absolute shambolic joke. I thought so much
                    higher of us than this. Stuff like this on top of the racist incidents makes me hang my head in utter shame. To those of you that did go today and did boo Jorginho how can you ever call yourself a real fan? Just a simple and utter
                    fucking disgrace. Jorginho is at the forefront of an attempted revolution at Chelsea with bringing attacking football for the first time in years and fans want to sing “fuck sarriball” and boo Jorginho. Yes I agree be angered, be angered
                    at Sarri’s stubbornness but you can only learn through mistakes let’s hope today was the learning curve. 6-0, and 4-0 hurt like nothing that’s happened before but give the man a fucking chance, give Jorginho a chance. If we are still
                    losing 6-0 next season with more of Sarri’s signings then so be it, sarri gotta go. But we are 6 months into his management when he had merely 5 days with his whole squad before his first match. Let’s have some patient!

                    I went today. Been a fan for a long time. Was a member at one point, was planning on applying for a season ticket after the email that was sent out sometime this week. Today I got assaulted by someone at the stadium during the match. Initially thought
                    it was a joke, then tried to deescalate, successfully so. Don't know why it happened - if it was 'cus I was brown or for some random reason. What I do know is that no one other than the person I was with said a word. Later, when leaving
                    at the end of the game, someone came up to me to ask if I was alright. The incident happened within the first 3 minutes. It's weird, and I won't say I'm shaken up but I'm deeply sad that something like this can happen at a place that
                    is responsible for so many positive memories. My shoulder is still sore (where I was grabbed), and I stupidly didn't report the person until the end, because I was afraid that the stewards wouldn't do anything and I'd have to sit in
                    the middle of a hostile environment, while ruining the first Chelsea match of my friend - who is also a long time fan.
