            <p class="main-paragraph">
                Chelsea was founded in 1905 by Gus Mears, an English businessman who had earlier bought the Stamford Bridge athletics stadium with the plan of transforming it into a football ground. His original idea was to rent it to an existing club, but after a deal
                with Fulham FC was halted, he got the idea to start a new club.

            <p class="main-paragraph">
                Chelsea would quickly prove to be a hit with the local supporters and established itself as the biggest club in the capital. In the late 1910s, the club became the first in Britain with an average attendance over 40,000. The huge attendance numbers made
                "The Pensioners", a nickname for the team, to one of the richest clubs in the country and made it possible to pay well reputed players. Chelsea become also home for the first non-British player in the Football League, the Danish Nils Middelboe,
                who arrived to the club in 1913.

            <p class="main-paragraph">
                Their first League title in 1955 was a shock for everyone, especially considering the club had finished in the bottom half of the league for most of the previous seasons. This unexpected success was not enough to turn their fortunes around, however, and
                the club soon returned to mediocrity. The mid-60s caught Chelsea at the height of their popularity, with many big-name celebrities becoming regular guests at Stamford Bridge. For the first time in their history, the club was seen as an
                actual contender. After securing their first League Cup in 1965, they followed it up with two more "firsts" by claiming an FA Cup in 1970 and a Cup Winners' Cup in 1971.

            <p class="main-paragraph">
                In 2003, Chelsea's landscape changed forever when the club was sold to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich. The new owner immediately led Chelsea to an era of financial stability, paying off the majority of the club's debts and spending a then-unprecedented
                amount of money on star signings. Still, it wasn't until José Mourinho's arrival that all the pieces fell into place; under the controversial Portuguese manager, Chelsea won back-to-back Premier League titles in 2005 and 2006, as well
                as two League Cups in 2005 and 2007 and an FA Cup in 2007.
            </p>

            <p class="main-paragraph">
                Even after Mourinho had left the club due to a number of disagreements with Abramovich, Chelsea continued to be a dominant force in English football, winning one more league title, two FA Cups, a Champions League and a Europa League in the next six years.
                Chelsea had never previously won the European Cup/Champions League or UEFA Cup/Europe League. Shortly after Mourinho's return in 2013, the club won another League Cup and their fifth league title. After a long period of weak performance,
                Chelsea sacked José Mourinho in 2015. In 2021, Chelsea won another UEFA Champions League with Thomas Tuchel as a coach.
